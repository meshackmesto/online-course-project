## Introduction
### Overview
 This project is an online course platform where users can explore various courses, enroll in their desired courses, and leave reviews. The application provides functionalities for user authentication (sign-up and log-in), course browsing, enrollment, and review submissions. The platform is built with a Flask backend and a React frontend.

## Key Features

- *User Authentication*: Users can sign up and log in to access their personalized dashboard.
- *Course Browsing*: Users can view a list of available courses.
- *Course Enrollment*: Users can enroll in courses and view them in the "My Courses" section.
- *Course Reviews*: Users can leave reviews for the courses they have taken.

### User Authentication
User authentication allows users to sign up and log in securely to access their personalized dashboard. This involves creating an account with a username, email, and password, and then logging in with those credentials. Security measures like password hashing and email verification are implemented to ensure user data is protected and only authorized users can access their information and course materials.

### Course Browsing
Course browsing enables users to view a list of available courses with essential details like title, description, instructor, and duration. It includes search and filter options to help users find courses that match their interests. Course previews provide snippets of content, aiding users in making informed decisions about enrollment.

### Course Enrollment
Course enrollment allows users to enroll in courses and view them in a personalized "My Courses" section. Users can easily sign up for courses, receive confirmation, and gain access to the course content. This feature helps users organize their learning and track their progress, making it easy to resume learning at any time.

### Course Reviews
Course reviews enable users to leave feedback and ratings for the courses they have taken. Reviews are displayed on the course page, helping prospective students gauge the quality and relevance of the course. This feature provides valuable feedback to instructors and builds trust and credibility within the learning community.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a typical full-stack structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend code.

SQLITE

 ## Backend Setup

 ### Navigate to the server directory 
 cd server/backend

 ### Install dependencies
 pipenv install
 pipenv shell

 ### Run the flask server
 python app.py


 ## Frontend Setup

 ### Navigate to the client directory
 cd client 

 ### Install dependencies
 npm install --prefix client

 ### Run the React application
 npm start --prefix client

  ## Database Setup
 ### Database Initialization

#### Navigate to the server directory
cd server

Then enter the commands to create the `instance` and `migrations` folders and
the database `app.db` file:

```
flask db init
flask db upgrade head
```

Type `tree -L 2` within the `server` folder to confirm the new directory
structure:

```console
.
├── app.py
├── config.py
├── instance
│   └── app.db
├── migrations
│   ├── README
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── alembic.ini
│   ├── env.py
│   ├── script.py.mako
│   └── versions
├── models.py
└── seed.py
```

Edit `models.py` and start creating your models. Import your models as needed in
other modules, i.e. `from models import ...`.

Remember to regularly run
`flask db revision --autogenerate -m'<descriptive message>'`, replacing
`<descriptive message>` with an appropriate message, and `flask db upgrade head`
to track your modifications to the database and create checkpoints in case you
ever need to roll those modifications back.

> **Tip: It's always a good idea to start with an empty revision! This allows
> you to roll all the way back while still holding onto your database. You can
> create this empty revision with `flask db revision -m'Create DB'`.**

If you want to seed your database, now would be a great time to write out your
`seed.py` script and run it to generate some test data. Faker has been included
in the Pipfile if you'd like to use that library.

#### `config.py`

When developing a large Python application, you might run into a common issue:
_circular imports_. A circular import occurs when two modules import from one
another, such as `app.py` and `models.py`. When you create a circular import and
attempt to run your app, you'll see the following error:

```console
ImportError: cannot import name
```

If you're going to need an object in multiple modules like `app` or `db`,
creating a _third_ module to instantiate these objects can save you a great deal
of circular grief. Here's a good start to a Flask config file (you may need more
if you intend to include features like authentication and passwords):

```py
# Standard library imports

# Remote library imports
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_restful import Api
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import MetaData

# Local imports

# Instantiate app, set attributes
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.json.compact = False

# Define metadata, instantiate db
metadata = MetaData(naming_convention={
    "fk": "fk_%(table_name)s_%(column_0_name)s_%(referred_table_name)s",
})
db = SQLAlchemy(metadata=metadata)
migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

# Instantiate REST API
api = Api(app)

# Instantiate CORS
CORS(app)

```

Now let's review that last line...

#### CORS

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system that uses HTTP headers to
determine whether resources from different servers-of-origin can be accessed. If
you're using the fetch API to connect your frontend to your Flask backend, you
need to configure CORS on your Flask application instance. Lucky for us, that
only takes one line:

```py
CORS(app)

```

By default, Flask-CORS enables CORS on all routes in your application with all
fetching servers. You can also specify the resources that allow CORS. The
following specifies that routes beginning with `api/` allow CORS from any
originating server:

```py
CORS(app, resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "*"}})

```

You can also set this up resource-by-resource by importing and using the
`@cross_origin` decorator:

```py
@app.route("/")
@cross_origin()
def howdy():
  return "Howdy partner!"

```

## Updating Your README.md

`README.md` is a Markdown file that describes your project. These files can be
used in many different ways- you may have noticed that we use them to generate
entire Canvas lessons- but they're most commonly used as homepages for online
Git repositories. **When you develop something that you want other people to
use, you need to have a README.**

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering
curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've
ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the
cheat sheet in this lesson's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit (you
can ignore your migration files) should get at least a paragraph. Each function
should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your application first, and with a good level of detail. The
rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably routes next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.

## Conclusion

A lot of work goes into a full-stack application, but it all relies on concepts
that you've practiced thoroughly throughout this phase. Hopefully this template
and guide will get you off to a good start with your Phase 4 Project.

Happy coding!
